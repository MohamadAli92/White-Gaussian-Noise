# White-Gaussian-Noise
In this project, I demonstrate the impact of white Gaussian noise.

- This project has been implemented using MATLAB.

- At first, the code records a voice using your mic to use it as the sample; you can specify the configuration of recorded audio.
- Then we add noise to the sound and try to denoise it.
- Now you can listen to the voice after noise and denoise and compare them using a graph.
